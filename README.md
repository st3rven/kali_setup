# kali_setup

Kali Setup script

The whole idea here is to use this script as a template for your preference tools. 

```
sudo ./setup.sh
```

### Docker option
For Kali docker you can use `setup_docker.sh` 


for default the majority of the options has been disable, feel free to change wherever you needs.
